# tryhackme-challenges
This repository is used for my cyber security adventures on TryHackMe.com

For context: [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com) is a service that provides lessons/challenges for all interested in Cyber Security.

This platform is great for me as I am currently studying Penetration Testing principles, methodologies and techniques.

The folders within this repository are named after Penetration Testing machines TryHackMe provide on their site and contain methods,
scripts, explanations and security recommendations.
